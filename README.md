# Lammens Jasper

## About me

Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jasper, and I am Belgian web developer who lives in Nijlen, a small town in the Kempen. Coding and
working together in a team towards a common goal are my greatest passions. Those became a reality when I started my
education as a web developer at the Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Antwerp and on the volleyball court of my local club. I
like to create things that will give my team the extra push to achieve our goals!

## Interests

When I am not sitting behind my desk, you can usually find me in the kitchen. I love to eat, drink and cook, whether it
is desserts or some other dish. I do not have one favorite cuisine, I like to try them all! This also led to me becoming
a vegetarian during the summer of 2021. If you want to know more about this, just ask! ðŸ˜‹

Another passion of mine is volleyball: I started at Smash Lier when I was 12 years old and still playing there now. In
addition to playing, I also coach and train various teams.

I like the balance of these 3 things: food, volleyball and code. Being passionate about food allows me to play
volleyball at a high (physical) level, but it also gives me the necessary nutrition to keep my brain focussed. The hours
on the court are the perfect change of scenery between the coffee machine and the desk. The code and technical stuff
allow me to overcome various challenges, which I gladly face!
